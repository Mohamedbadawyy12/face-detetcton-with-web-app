# Real-Time Face & Feature Detection Web App

This project is a simple yet powerful web application for real-time detection of faces, eyes, and smiles in user-uploaded images. The app is built with Python using OpenCV for the core computer vision logic and Streamlit for the interactive web user interface.

## üöÄ About The Project

The goal of this project was to create an interactive web application that leverages classic machine learning models for computer vision tasks. The application uses pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers, which are efficient and effective for detecting objects like faces and facial features in real-time.

The user can upload an image through a simple web interface and select which feature they want to detect (faces, eyes, or smiles). The application then processes the image and displays the output with the detected features highlighted by bounding boxes.
